        [Tutorial] How to Control Background Running Apps in MIUI
    </string>

    <string name="Tutorial_introduce"><b>Hello Mi Fans</b>,
        \nManaging background running apps is one of the most useful
        features of MIUI. It was not an easy task before when we had
        no control over background running apps. Most of the time
        unnecessary apps misuse system space and keep running in the
        background, and sometimes we miss important notifications
        because the app is not running in the background. To manage
        this and make everything friendly, MIUI brings the background
        running apps managing feature.<br />
        \nYou can manage which apps will auto start and which apps will
        not. You can also lock apps in the recent task list to keep the
        apps always running. There is another option to manage app
        background restriction while battery saver is on. Let\'s startâ€¦
    </string>



    <string name="Tutorial_Lock_App_in_Recent">
        <b>1. Lock Apps in Recent</b>
        \nWhen you are temporarily running an app and don\'t want to clear the app from the Recent list,
        then simply lock the app in the Recent list. To lock apps in Recent, follow the below steps...
        \n&#8226;&#32;Go to Recent
        \n&#8226;&#32;Tap and hold on the app
        \n&#8226;&#32;Tap on the lock icon
        \n&#8226;&#32;The app is now locked
    </string>

    <string name="Tutorial_Enable_Autostart">
        <b>2. MIUI Autostart</b>
        \nSome apps may incorrectly indicate that MIUI has prevented
        them to start in background, or apps stopped their background
        activity after a certain time of locking the screen or push
        notifications are not instantly coming after cleaning the RAM.
        Then just follow the below steps to solve this problem.
        Open Settings
        \n&#8226;&#32;Go to Apps
        \n&#8226;&#32;Go to Autostart
        \n&#8226;&#32;Enable desired apps
    </string>

    <string name="Tutorial_App_Battery_Saver">
        <b>3. App Battery Saver</b>
        \nWhen the battery saver is active you may not receive notifications from some apps. Because by default MIUI battery saver restricts those apps to run in the background. To keep running those apps in this condition, you need to turn off restriction for the apps from App battery saver settings.
        \n&#8226;&#32;Go to Settings
        \n&#8226;&#32;Battery &#38; performance
        \n&#8226;&#32;Choose apps
        \n&#8226;&#32;Select apps and set \"No restrictions\"
    </string>
